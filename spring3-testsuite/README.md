spring3-testsuite
====================

A suite of tests for the swagger-springmvc project

- Deploys the swagger-ui code as generated by the sub-project 'swagger-ui'
- If tests start failing or the oauth integration stops foring the 1st place to look is 'swaggerUiInclude.gradle'
which does code replacement on some of the swagger ui files

- Running the app:

```./gradlew :spring3-testsuite:tomcatRun -i```

var redirectUrl = host.protocol + '//' + host.host + "/spring3-accounting/o2c.html";
```
