spring3-testsuite
====================

A suite of tests for the swagger-springmvc project

- Deploys the swagger-ui code as generated by the sub-project 'swagger-ui'
- If tests start failing or the oauth integration stops foring the 1st place to look is 'swaggerUiInclude.gradle'
which does code replacement on some of the swagger ui files
