spring3-testsuite
====================

A suite of tests for the swagger-springmvc project

- Deploys the swagger-ui code as generated by the sub-project 'swagger-ui'
- If tests start failing or the oauth integration stops foring the 1st place to look is 'swaggerUiInclude.gradle'
which does code replacement on some of the swagger ui files

#### Running the app:

```./gradlew :spring3-testsuite:tomcatRun -i```

Browse to: http://localhost:9080/spring3-testsuite/index.html


#### Functional tests:

Api level/integration tests that hit a running server to verify http json responses

```
./gradlew :spring3-testsuite:functionalTest -i

```

#### Where is the swagger ui code?
The swagger ui code is added at runtime via 'swaggerUiInclude.gradle' build the project first if you want to inspect
the swagger-ui code

#### Acceptance tests
- Running from ide add a jvm param: `-Dgeb.env=chrome` or `-Dgeb.env=firefox`

```
 -Dgeb.env=chrome -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/home/adrian/development/swagger-springmvc-demo/spring3-testsuite/build/drivers/chrome/chromedriver
```


- Headless

```
sudo apt-get install xvfb
